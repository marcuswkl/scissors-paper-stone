Develop a simple distributed system with application of principles and protocols of distributed computing.

This assignment requires you to design a distributed system that is scalable and reliable. You are required to demonstrate the ability to apply your knowledge on distributed system in your implementation of the solution. You are also required to familiarise yourself with middleware to harness the scalability and reliability that it offers.

Propose a Distributed System Project such as the following:
-	Distributed Race Car / Games
-	Distributed shared white board
-	Distributed file sharing
-	Distributed chat system
-	â€¦

You are required to design and develop the proposed distributed system with scalability and reliability. You should use middleware such as AKKA to support your development. You have to produce a system architecture design that explains the physical model and interactive model of the distributed system. This system should utilise distributed system concept in designing and developing. The system should be able to work on Internet architecture. You could use Hamachi VPN network to test your program. You should design a test case for your proposed system to test the handling of communication omission or process omission.
